Program description:
--------------------------------------
This was a program that I worked on as a member of the ACM SIGAI club at purdue. We were
given a procedurely generated maze with a start and end point and we had to find a path
from the start to the end using breath first search, depth first search and A star algorithms.
It was a simple project to help us learn the basics of search algorithms which we would later
be using for webcrawling or decision making.
